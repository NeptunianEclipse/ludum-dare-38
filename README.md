# Debug Defence

*Your computer is acting a bit buggy. When you open it up you discover why: there is an onslaught of literal bugs streaming towards the CPU! You must build electrical defences on your computer's circuitboards to stop the bugs and rescue your files.*

This is a game made in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 38 game jam. The theme was **A Small World**.

I made the game using the Phaser library and otherwise vanilla JavaScript. It was my first time using something other than Unity for a jam, and was very fun overall although
I wasn't able to spend as much time on it as I would have liked. There are instructions and more info on the [itch.io page](https://neptunianeclipse.itch.io/debug-defence).

Special thanks to:
- NZObiwan for the ideas and implementation of two towers and two enemies
- EeveeDinah for some improved tower and enemy sprites
